- [Overview]
This is a website designed to practice HTML and CSS, a project provided by Frontend Mentor.

- [What I Learned](#what-I-learned)
In this project, I focused on making the site more responsive and improving my performance with CCS.

ul, ol {
margin-top: 1em;
margin-left: 3.4em;
list-style: none;
counter-reset: item;

}
ul li::before {
content: "\2022"; color: var(--Brown800);

display: inline-block;
width: 1.5em;
margin-left: -1.5em;
}

I learned how to change list markers, something I had no idea how to do.
